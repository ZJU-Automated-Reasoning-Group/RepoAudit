# RepoAudit

RepoAudit is a repo-level bug detector for general bugs. Currently, it supports the detection of diverse bug types (such as Null Pointer Dereference, Memory Leak, and Use After Free) in multiple programming languages (including C/C++, Java, Python, and Go). It leverages [LLMSCAN](https://github.com/PurCL/LLMSCAN) to parse the codebase and uses LLM to mimic the process of manual code auditing. Compared with existing code auditing tools, RepoAudit offers the following advantages:

- 🛡️ **Compilation-Free Analysis**
- 🌍 **Multi-Lingual Support**
- 🐞 **Multiple Bug Type Detection**
- ⚙️ **Customization Support**

## News 📰

**[June 2025]** The preprint of "An LLM Agent for Functional Bug Detection in Network Protocols" has been released, providing the technical details of `rfcscan`!

**[May 2025]** 🎉 Our paper "RepoAudit: Automated Code Auditing with Multi-Agent LLM Framework" has been accepted at ICML 2025! 🏆

**[March 2025]** RepoAudit has helped identify over 100 bugs in open-source projects this quarter!

## Agents in RepoAudit

RepoAudit is a multi-agent framework for code auditing. We offer two agent instances in our current version:

- **MetaScanAgent** in `metascan.py`: Scan the project using tree-sitter–powered parsing-based analyzers and obtains the basic syntactic properties of the program.

- **DFBScanAgent** in `dfbscan.py`: Perform inter-procedural data-flow analysis as described in this [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18160). It detects data-flow bugs, including source-must-not-reach-sink bugs (e.g., Null Pointer Dereference) and source-must-reach-sink bugs (e.g., Memory Leak).

We are keeping implementing more agents and will open-source them very soon. Utilizing DFBScanAgent and other agents, we have discovered hundred of confirmed and fixed bugs in open-source community. You can refer to this [bug list](https://repoaudit-home.github.io/bugreports.html).

## Installation

1. Create and activate a conda environment with Python 3.13:

   ```sh
   conda create -n repoaudit python=3.13
   conda activate repoaudit
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```sh
   cd RepoAudit
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure you have the Tree-sitter library and language bindings installed:

   ```sh
   cd lib
   python build.py
   ```

4. Configure the OpenAI API key and Anthropic API key:

   ```sh
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=xxxxxx >> ~/.bashrc
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=xxxxxx >> ~/.bashrc
   ```


## Quick Start

1. We have prepared several benchmark programs in the `benchmark` directory for a quick start. Some of these are submodules, so you may need to initialize them using the following commands:

   ```sh
   cd RepoAudit
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

2. We provide the script `src/run_repoaudit.sh` to scan files in the `benchmark/Java/toy/NPD` directory. You can run the following commands:

   ```sh
   cd src
   sh run_repoaudit.sh  # Run the agent DFBScanAgent
   ```

3. After the scanning is complete, you can check the resulting JSON and log files.


## Parallel Auditing Support

For a large repository, a sequential analysis process may be quite time-consuming. To accelerate the analysis, you can choose parallel auditing. Specifically, you can set the option `--max-neural-workers` to a larger value. By default, this option is set to 30 for parallel auditing.
Also, we have set the parsing-based analysis in a parallel mode by default, which is determined by the option `--max-symbolic-workers`. The default maximal number of workers is 30.

## Website, Documentation and Papers

We have open-sourced the implementation of [dfbscan](https://github.com/PurCL/RepoAudit). Other agents in RepoAudit will be released soon. For more information, please visit our website: [RepoAudit: Auditing Code As Human](https://repoaudit-home.github.io/).
